# Joke Generator Web Application ðŸ˜‚

Welcome to the Joke Generator web application! In this project, I've developed a simple yet entertaining web app that retrieves jokes from an external API. With just a click of a button, you can generate a random joke that's sure to bring a smile to your face.

## How It Works

The Joke Generator fetches jokes from the JokeAPI. Here's how it works:

1. Click the "Get Random Joke" button.
2. The web app will connect to the JokeAPI and fetch a joke.
3. The fetched joke will be displayed with a playful emoji.
4. Enjoy a good laugh!

## Acknowledgments

This project has been a fantastic opportunity for me to learn about fetching data from APIs and dynamically updating a web page. I hope you find this web app amusing and enjoyable!
